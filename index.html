Located right in the heart of the city, it is also an architectural marvel which was established around 150 years ago. In the best possible words, the Napier Museum is a delight for adults and children alike. The museum houses one of the oldest zoological gardens in India in its premises. The museum itself, based on the Indo-Saracenic styles of architecture is one of the most visited art and natural history museums in India. With works of famous artists, such as Raja Ravi Varma, and the celebrated Russian theosophist, Nicholas Roerich, and specimens of Tanjore and Mughal art forms, history was never more fun for those willing to delve into it.</P>

Kovalam first received prominence when the Regent Maharani of Travancore, Sethu Lakshmi Bayi constructed the first beach resort known as the Halcyon Castle during the 1920. The place then started gaining increasing attention as tourists from all over the world started flocking to Kovalam. The major phase where Kovalam shot into limelight was during the 1970’s when hippies all teh way from Ceylon came to Kovalam.

                    <p>Tangled is a reimagining of the classic Rapunzel tale and a Disney "princess" movie that's sure to entertain both boys and girls. Rapunzel (voiced by Mandy Moore) isn't the typical princess in need of rescuing; she does her fair share of saving Flynn Rider (Zachary Levi) -- who's no Prince Charming. There's a lot of romantic chemistry between them (flirting, gazing, and eventually hand-holding, embracing, and a kiss or two), as well as a couple of creepy scenes in which the youthful-looking Mother Gothel uses her beauty to lure men to do what she wants. Expect some nearly constant cartoon violence -- one character dies, another one nearly dies after being pierced by a knife, and there are plenty of last-minute escapes from arrows, horse-mounted soldiers, fire, etc. Characters are hit on the head with a frying pan and kicked in the head; others hold knives and spears in threatening ways. The movie's messages about girl power and seeing beyond appearances are positive and inspiring; kids will learn that we all have dreams, and we should do everything we can to make them come true.</p>

According to Telegraph World, the company makes 60 billion blocks a year. While LEGO want to replace the harmful plastic used in their products, they also require the new material to meet the high standards that allow the blocks to work as they always have, especially with the effective “clicking” together is a key aspect of the iconic coloured block.

However, international concerns raised at the time were countered by the Brazilian Government, which claimed the fire situation in August was 'normal' and 'below the historical average'.An international team of scientists writing in the journal Global Change Biology say the number of active fires in August was actually three times higher than in 2018 and the highest number since 2010.
